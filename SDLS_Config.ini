[Cleanup options]
# Removes all files created by SDLS before closing, because otherwise they would cause problems with Vortex
# So basically, if a user had SDLS installed, and used Vortex to manage their mods, if they wanted to remove
# a mod, Vortex would only remove the .sdls files, and not the .json files, which would cause the game to
# still run them, and the user would have no clue why.
doCleanup = true

[Logging]
# Debug timers are used to benchmark performance.
# Will log the time it takes to complete certain actions in the log.
logDebugTimers = false


# DISABLED OPTIONS. IN DEVELOPMENT. WILL CAUSE SEVERE PROBLEMS IF CHANGED
[Merge options]
# Decided whether to merge mods or not.
# If true, creates a new directory in which it creates the merged JSON.
# DO NOT DISTRIBUTE MERGED JSON. IT WILL CONTAIN ALL MODS YOU HAVE INSTALLED, WHICH BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE MOD AUTHORS.
doMerge = false
# Sends messages in the console and in SDLS_Merge_Conflicts.log for every single conflict.
logMergeConflicts = true

[EXPERIMENTAL]
# Flatout loads the entirely of the basegame json before merging mods, making sure there are absolutely no conflicts with the basegame.
# Will cause significant slowdowns and memory usage. Extremely experimental and unoptimized feature.
# This will make every log from logMergeConflicts unreliable. It is advised to turn the option off when using this feature.

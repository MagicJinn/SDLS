# Flatout loads the entirely of the basegame json before merging mods, making sure there are absolutely no conflicts with the basegame

[Cleanup options]
# Removes all files created by SDLS before closing, because otherwise they would cause problems with Vortex
# So basically, if a user had SDLS installed, and used Vortex to manage their mods, if they wanted to remove
# a mod, Vortex would only remove the .sdls files, and not the .json files, which would cause the game to
# still run them, and the user would have no clue why.
